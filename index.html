        <p>Hamo was born in 1867 in Zion. His family was a very poor and angry.<br>
        He grew up mean and bad and quickly learned that he has to take rather than give.<br>
        In 1894 he broke the neck of King Shaban the Third and became the first King of <br>
        Timbuktu, who was not of royal blood. <br><br>
        He died as King in 1999 at age of 132.</p>
